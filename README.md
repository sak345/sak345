I'm a 3rd engineering student pursuing B.E. in ENI and M.Sc. in Mathematics at the prestigious Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. I'm a perpetual learner, often spending late nights experimenting with code and contributing to the Stack Overflow community. In high school, I discovered my true calling in computer science, which has been my path ever since. My love for programming deepens as my journey unfolds.
